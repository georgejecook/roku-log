## Development

mLog is an independent open-source project, maintained exclusively by volunteers.

You might want to help! Get in touch via the slack group, or raise issues.

## About mLog

mLog is a logging framework for Roku Scenegraph apps. It is specifically tailored to the nuances of Roku development. Notably it is:

 - Lightweight in both performance and syntax
 - Works across nodes, tasks and thread boundaries
 - Crash safe: i.e it safely logs values, without crashing on invalid, undefined, or unexpected value types
 - Highly configurable: You can configure log levels, include and exclude filters, various log transports, light logging mode, and more
 - compatible with various log transports - you can log to the following transports:
   - print - i.e. telnet output
   - screen - screen overlay
   - node/RALE (Roku Advanced Layout Editor) - log lines go to a node, where you can read/copy the values from
   - easy to add more - anyone want to add a socket transport? pm me

### mLog and performance

Performance is absolutely critical in Roku apps - mLog gives you professional-grade logging functionality while giving you various performance options:

 - Full featured, multi transport logging, with on-device filtering
 - Light logging (all logging is simple print statements), with no filtering
 - Disabled - any mLog calls will return instantly, without incurring any logging penalty
 - Fully disabled - all log lines are commented out - this means you won't even incur variable/string reference performance penalties.

### mLog, Burp and vscode-brightscript-language extension, sitting in a tree l o g g i n g

 mLog can leverage [burp-brightscript](https://github.com/georgejecook/burp) (brightscript file processing framework) to allow it to give you the best logging experience. mLog will automatically put burp compatible constants in your log output so you can benefit from:

  - file name, function name and line number in your log output
  - `pkg:file.brs(lineNumber)` log format, which gives you clickable log lines in [vscode brightscript language extension] (https://github.com/TwitchBronBron/vscode-brightscript-language/)
  - ability to easily comment out log lines.

[Here's an example of what you can get set up](https://imgur.com/GcUK9iO)

# Using mLog

## Quick start

 1. Download the latest zip release
 1. Copy `dist/components/mLog` to your project's components folder (e.g whatever equates to `pkg:/components` at runtime)
 1. Copy `dist/source/mLog` to your project's source folder (e.g whatever equates to `pkg:/source` at runtime)
 1. Import the mLog mixin script, in your main scene xml file `<script type="text/brightscript" uri="pkg:/source/mLog/rLogMixin.brs" />`
 1. Create an mLog instance in your main scene e.g, in your main scene's brs init function, add `m.top._rLog = initializeRlog()` - pro tip: make it available as an interface variable for runtime inspection with [RALE](https://sdkdocs.roku.com/display/sdkdoc/Roku+Advanced+Layout+Editor)
 1. Register your class (i.e. module, or scenegraph component) with the logger, with a call to `registerLogger("ComponentName")`, with the name you wish mLog to use for log output
 1. Begin logging, using the mLog log methods, e.g. `logVerbose("Keypress {0}", key)`
 1. For better results, wire up with [burp-brightscript](https://github.com/georgejecook/burp), as described below
## Logging API

For full API, see the [docs](https://georgejecook.github.io/mLog)

### initializeRlog

`initializeRLog(isForcedOff = false, isLightForcedOn = false, isLightForcedOff = false, isPrintingName = false) as object`

This call must be made to create the mLog instance, which will be stored in global. As a convenience, the instance is also returned, for further configuration.

Note, you can force rlog off, or light logging on for everything, or off for everything. Pro tip: You can pass these values in from your manifest, which in turn can be configured by your build pipeline.

note printing the log name is off by default - You will get best results using [burp-brightscript](https://github.com/georgejecook/burp) which will give you line numbers and accurate method names in your logs

### registerLogger

`registerLogger(name = "general", isLight = false, target = invalid) as object`

Before you can invoke the logging methods, you have to register a logger. The `registerLogger` method is used for this purpose.

The logger will decorate the `target` in the args with the logger helpers. If invalid, this is assumed to be the value of `m`. This works fine for scenegraph nodes. However, if you you are using a module pattern, then you will want to pass in a reference to your module as the target argument. 

### General logging with logXXX methods

`logXXX(message, value = "#RLN#", value2 = "#RLN#", value3 = "#RLN#", value4 = "#RLN#", value5 = "#RLN#", value6 = "#RLN#", value7 = "#RLN#", value8 = "#RLN#", value9 = "#RLN#") as void`

mLog provides logging methods, which all have the same signature for the following levels

 - verbose - logVerbose
 - debug - logDebug
 - method - logMethod
 - info - logInfo
 - warn - logWarn
 - error  - logError

 The signature is as follows:

 `(message, value0, ..., value9)`

- message - the string message you wish to log
- value0..9 - values, which are appended to the message (surrounded by a space character). Values are automatically converted to a string. arrays, json and node types are pretty printed.

Note that the output includes the log level, and the class doing the logging, as set in your call to `registerLogger`

Also note, all the `logXXX` methods are available on `m`

### log method scope

the log helpers are by defualt scoped to `m`. As a convenience, you can call `logXXX`. However, if your scope is not the node's `m` scope, i.e. you are wishing to log from a module, then you mus use `m.logXXX` methods.

For example, in `NetModule.brs`

```
function createModule()
  module = {
    callNet: netMixin_callNet
  }

  return registerLogger("NetModule", false, module)
end function

function netMixin_callNet()
  m.logMethod("callNet")
end function
```


## Using with burp brightscript (or any other processor)

For best results, you can process your files prior to execution, to replace mLog calls, with more precise line information. Here's an example burp script, if you use [burp-brightscript](https://github.com/georgejecook/burp)

#### burpConfig-dev.json
```
{
  "sourcePath": "build",
  "globPattern": "**/*.brs",
  "replacements": [
    {
      "regex": "(^.*(logInfo|logError|logVerbose|logDebug)\\((\\s*\"))",
      "replacement": "$1#FullPath# "
    },
    {
      "regex": "(^.*(logMethod)\\((\\s*\"))",
      "replacement": "$1#FullPath# "
    }
  ]
}
```

It is run with the following command sa part of the project's build process:

```
burp p burpConfig-Dev.json
```

## FAQ
### Is mLog ready for production use?
mLog is the 3rd generation of my logging ideas on roku. The other 3 generations are all in production channels. I'm using this in my own work.

### Is mLog actively maintained?
I am actively invovled in rLogs's development, and add more features and fixes on a weekly basis. You can expect rapid responses to issues.
